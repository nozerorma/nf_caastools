# Add RERconverge package manually to the R library of the newly created environment
## I could not find the culprit to this. Both BioConda and BioContainers RERConverge images fail to
## properly add the package to the library. RERConverge was still specified in the conda env.yml
## as I'm pretty confident it does install its requirements, as the image stayed pretty the same
## size-wise. This should be furtherly inspected though.
